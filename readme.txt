Readme.txt file for final project

Bailey Blum and Jack Hill.

For the final project we made a version of the game asteroids. A small triangle
is controlled by the user of the program. This triangle is able to turn 360
degrees by using the 't' 'g' 'f' and 'h' buttons to turn and go forwards and
backwards. The triangle shoots small balls when the user presses the spacebar.
The goal of the game is to shoot all three balls without getting hit by one of
the balls, which are bouncing around the screen. The game ends when the user is
either hit by a ball or shoots all the balls. Whenever one of these things
happen, the game restarts if the user presses space and quits if the user
presses 'q'. We found the refresh rate on our computers was much better when we 
eliminated changing of colors. Thus, our program is all white in color to 
increase the fluidity of its running.
